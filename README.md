# GGJ2025.

This is our attempt to develop a game in 48 hours as part of this year's Global Game Jam. We were prompted to stick with the theme: "Bubbles".

## Last Bubble Bender ðŸ«§

Last Bubble Bender is a high-energy, local-multiplayer arcade game where two mischievous bubble monsters face off in a battle of bouncy bubbles and clever strategy! Armed with the power to blow bubbles that bounce unpredictably around the arena, youâ€™ll need to outwit your opponent and become the ultimate bubble bender.
